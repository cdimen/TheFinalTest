For adding the MyFile.txt file = git add "MyFile.txt"
For adding the project to source control = git init

I again used the git add command to add the new files to the source control

To change the username = git config --global "username"

To see the current state of the project = git status

I learned that git status shows the files that are added and commited into the project source
